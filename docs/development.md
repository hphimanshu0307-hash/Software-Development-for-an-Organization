# Development & Iteration Process

This document describes how the ERP system evolved from initial planning to a
stable, production-ready platform.

---

## Planning & Requirements

Development began with an analysis of existing workflows, compliance needs,
and operational bottlenecks. The goal was to replace manual processes without
interrupting ongoing operations.

Key priorities included:
- User adoption with minimal training
- Modular design for future expansion
- Operational reliability
- Data accuracy and consistency

---

## Build Process

The system was developed using a design-to-production workflow, enabling rapid
prototyping and validation with users. Core operational modules were prioritized
before expanding into compliance, reporting, and financial workflows.

---

## Iteration & Refinement

After deployment, the system underwent continuous refinement driven by real
usage. Feedback highlighted performance issues, usability improvements, and
automation opportunities, which were addressed through incremental updates.

Changes were rolled out in phases to avoid disrupting active users.

---

## Stability & Optimization

Performance optimization, error handling, and system reliability became key
focus areas as usage scaled. Enhancements emphasized robustness over feature
quantity.

---

## Reflection

Developing this system required balancing technical decisions with real-world
constraints. The experience reinforced the importance of building systems that
serve users, adapt to feedback, and remain dependable under daily use.
