# System Architecture

The ERP system follows a modular architecture designed for scalability,
maintainability, and continuous use in a production environment.

---

## Architectural Overview

The platform is composed of independent functional modules built around a
centralized data layer. This design allows individual components to evolve
without impacting the stability of the overall system.

---

## Core Modules

- Operations & inspections
- Personnel & access management
- Compliance & audit tracking
- Financial workflows & reporting
- Document storage & retrieval
- Analytics and dashboards

---

## Data Flow

Operational data is captured through role-based interfaces and stored
centrally. Authorized users access insights through dashboards and reports,
ensuring consistency and controlled visibility across departments.

---

## Design Principles

- Reliability under continuous use
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal disruption during updates
- Ease of iteration based on user feedback

---

## Security & Access

Access is enforced through role-based permissions. Sensitive data is restricted
to authorized roles and handled according to organizational policies.
