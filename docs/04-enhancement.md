# System Enhancements

Following initial deployment, the ERP system was extended with data-driven
features designed to improve operational and financial decision-making.

## Motivation

As usage increased, it became clear that operational data could be used not
only for record-keeping but also for forecasting, risk identification, and
process optimization.

## Enhancements Implemented

- Operational and financial trend analysis
- Anomaly detection for irregular activity
- Predictive insights for planning and resource allocation
- Improved reporting dashboards for management decisions

## Design Approach

Enhancements were integrated into existing workflows to ensure adoption.
The focus was on practical improvements rather than experimental features.

## Outcome

The enhancements improved visibility, reduced manual oversight, and enabled
more informed decisions without increasing system complexity.
