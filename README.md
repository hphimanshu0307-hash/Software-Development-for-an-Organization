# Enterprise ERP System

This repository documents the design, development, and real-world deployment
of a full-scale ERP system built for a 20+ year-old organization to manage
operations, personnel, compliance, and financial workflows.

The system is actively used by approximately 300 users across departments
and supports daily operational decision-making.

---

## Background

The organization previously relied on fragmented tools and manual processes
for managing inspections, personnel records, compliance documentation,
billing, and internal reporting. These limitations created inefficiencies,
data silos, and scaling challenges.

---

## Solution

I designed and implemented a centralized ERP platform that unifies operational,
administrative, and financial workflows into a single system. The platform was
developed using a design-to-production workflow, allowing rapid iteration,
validation with real users, and deployment in a production environment.

The system was built to support continuous use, incremental upgrades, and
organizational growth without disrupting daily operations.

---

## Core Capabilities

- Operations and inspection management
- Personnel and role-based access control
- Compliance and audit tracking
- Financial workflows and reporting
- Centralized document management
- Performance and activity dashboards

---

## Enhancements

After deployment, the system was extended with data-driven features to improve
operational and financial visibility. These enhancements support forecasting,
anomaly detection, and decision support while integrating seamlessly into
existing workflows.
